# How to Update or Add Work Experience & Education

You can easily add, edit, or remove Work Experience and Education items using React properties and components!

## ‚ú® Add or Update "Highlights" Section (Good at, Interested at, Work on)

You can personalize the top section of your About page (the ‚ÄúI am good at‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am interested at‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI work on‚Äù cards) by editing the `AboutHighlights` component props inside `src/pages/About.tsx`.

1. Open `src/pages/About.tsx`.

2. Find the `AboutHighlights` component, which looks like this:
   ```jsx
   <AboutHighlights
     goodAt={[
       "Python & TypeScript",
       "Machine Learning",
       "React & Frontend",
       "Problem Solving",
     ]}
     interestedAt={[
       "Reinforcement Learning",
       "AI Product Design",
       "MLOps & scalability",
       "Effective Teamwork",
     ]}
     workOn={[
       "Startup XYZ (ML Intern)",
       "Student Research Clubs",
       "Hackathons & Open Source",
     ]}
   />
   ```

3. **To edit highlight lists:**
   - Change, add, or remove items in any of the `goodAt`, `interestedAt`, or `workOn` props.
   - You can use as many items as you like in each array, and the UI will update.

4. **Save the file**‚Äîyour changes will be visible immediately on the About page!

       title: "Machine Learning Intern",
       org: "Startup XYZ",
       location: "Remote",
       period: "May 2024 ‚Äì Jul 2024",
